Graham's scan is a method of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane with time complexity O(n log n).

I used in Generation of convex meshes , colliders , isometric surface coverings generally in game theory and mesh generation

We can integrate this logic to large vertice sets and arrays containing data structures to create accurate surfaces

If we interpolate this neighboor data structures with edges of polygons there can be pretty smooth meshes

Usage 

	List<Vector2> coordinates = Arrays.asList(new Vector2[] {
				new Vector2(-1, 3), new Vector2(3, 1), new Vector2(1, 1),
				new Vector2(0, -1), new Vector2(-2, 1), new Vector2(-1, 2),
				new Vector2(0, 0) });

		// find the convex hull
		List<Vector2> convexHull = new GrahamsScan().GetConvexHull(coordinates);

		for (Vector2 p : convexHull) {
			System.out.print(p.x);
			System.out.print("/");
			System.out.print(p.y);
			System.out.println();
		}
